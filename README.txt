#World_Clock
(This is a duplicate README of the README.me)

I used a "Nexus 5X API 25 x86" virtual device with Android Studio in order to run application, but I've also used a "Pixel API 25" as well as a "Galaxy Nexus API 25" virtual device. Some of the methods require a minimum SDK of 17. This has been adjusted in the app's gradle.build file. The app has three interactable features:

2 Buttons. One named "24-HOUR MODE" and the other name "12-HOUR MODE" which once clicked, change the format of time being presented at the top to a 24-hour format, or a 12-hour format respectively.
Spinner drop down menu that holds different kinds of cities that the user can choose from.
Once a city is selected, the time will update to the correct time associated with the region's time zone.
The clock's time shows current seconds, and will continously update every second. I hope you enjoy the app!
